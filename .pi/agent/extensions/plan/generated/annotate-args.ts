/**
 * Parse CLI-style args arriving as a single whitespace-delimited string.
 *
 * Extracts the `--gate`, `--json`, and `--hook` flags (issue #570)
 * from the remainder, which is treated as the target path. Leading `@` is
 * stripped via the shared at-reference helper — reference-mode is primary.
 * Scoped-package-style literal `@` paths are handled by a fallback that the
 * downstream resolver opts into (see at-reference.ts).
 *
 * Used by the plugin and Pi extension, where the whole args string
 * arrives pre-joined from the harness slash-command dispatcher. The Claude
 * Code binary parses argv directly with indexOf/splice and does not use
 * this helper.
 *
 * Implementation: walks the raw string once, preserving whitespace runs and
 * non-whitespace tokens as separate segments. Only known flag tokens
 * (whole-word match) plus one adjacent whitespace run are removed.
 * This keeps double-spaces and tabs inside file paths intact — which
 * matches the pre-PR behavior on `main`, where Pi passed
 * the raw args string straight through to the filesystem resolver.
 *
 * Remaining edge: if a path literally contains a known flag as a standalone
 * whitespace-separated token (e.g. `"Feature --gate spec.md"`), that token
 * is stripped. Supporting this would need shell-style quoting, which isn't
 * worth the complexity for a vanishingly rare naming pattern.
