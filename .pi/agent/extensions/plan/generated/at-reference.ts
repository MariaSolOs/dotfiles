/**
 * `@`-reference handling for user-provided paths.
 *
 * Several agent harnesses (Claude Code, OpenCode, Pi) let users reference
 * files with an `@` prefix, e.g. `@README.md`. The `@` is the team's
 * reference marker, not part of the filename. Stripping it is the primary
 * resolution path — that's the common case and it's supported first-class.
 *
 * The secondary path handles scoped-package-style names like
 * `@scope/pkg/README.md`: if the stripped form doesn't resolve, fall back
 * to the literal form so those paths still open.
 *
 * Both functions are pure and take any filesystem-ish predicate via a
 * callback, so they're trivial to unit-test without stubbing anything.

 * Normalize a user-typed path reference by unwrapping matching `"..."` or

 * harnesses that tokenize on whitespace (OpenCode, Pi), where paths
 * containing spaces have to be quoted. The quote-stripping has to run
 * first so the `@` check sees the real first character.
 *
 * Non-`@` inputs are returned unchanged except for quote unwrapping.
 * Does not recurse: `@@foo` becomes `@foo`, not `foo`.
