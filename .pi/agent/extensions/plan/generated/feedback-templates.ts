/**
 * Shared feedback templates for all agent integrations.
 *
 * The plan deny template was tuned in #224 / commit 3dca977 to use strong
 * directive framing — Claude was ignoring softer phrasing.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: This module is imported by packages/ui/utils/parser.ts which is
 * bundled into the browser SPA. It must NOT import from ./prompts or ./config
 * (which depend on node:fs, node:os, node:child_process). Keep it self-contained.
 *
 * Server-side call sites use getPlanDeniedPrompt() from ./prompts directly.
 * This module is only kept for the browser's wrapFeedbackForAgent clipboard feature.
