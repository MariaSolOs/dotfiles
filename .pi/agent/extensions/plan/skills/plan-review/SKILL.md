# Plan Review

Use this skill when the user wants to review current code changes in Plan instead of reading a diff inline.

Run:

```bash
plan review [optional-pr-url]
```

Behavior:

1. Launch the command with Bash.
2. Wait for it to finish.
3. If it returns feedback or annotations, address them in the same conversation.
4. If it returns an approval/LGTM-style message, acknowledge that review passed and continue.

Do not ask the user to copy shell commands into chat. Run the command yourself.
